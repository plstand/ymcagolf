# YMCA golf tester

## Purpose

This test program and corresponding example solution are for the "[It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/6695/its-fun-to-stay-at-the-y-m-c-a)" challenge on the Programming Puzzles and Code Golf Stack Exchange site. More details are available there.

## Build instructions

Compile with `make`. Optionally, use `make test` to verify proper functioning.

## Usage

Specify a shell command line that runs your program (redirecting standard output to a PTY) as a single argument:

    ./tester ./example

If that argument is omitted, the tester reads standard input (and does not use a PTY):

    ./example | ./tester

The tester and example program include a newline after each letter. Modify the YMCA() macro in ymca_timing.h to change this.
